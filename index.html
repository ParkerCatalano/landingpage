        <h2>Personal Life/Background</h2>
        <p>Since I was very young I have been extremely motivated to draw and make art with various mediums.  I eventually got into an art High School in San Francisco where I studied visual art for three years.  Although my college career ended up being a Literary one, I am still as fond of visual art as I ever was, and feel that I will be able to incorporate my skills into the programming and development world in a design capacity.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
        <p>I began working at a startup called MOG founded by my close family friend David Hyman, Co-founder of the track-finding software Gracenote in 2006.  It was a summer job and I was doing mostly QA and beta testing for the site's various widgets and extensions, as well as some blog post editing.  It was technically a paid internship, and I was very fortunate to be able to experience a workplace like that at my age.  It taught me a lot of very valuable lessons about the strtup world and the problems that face even a well funded website.
